# CodeForcesDecoder
Decodes CodeForces Problems Using a Transformer Model

> work in progress.  

## TODO:
- pull data from codeforces
    - it seems like the API only returns the meta data of each problem      <span style="color:green">Done</span>
    - use [this](https://github.com/kerolloz/codeforces-problem-scraper-api) to find the problem statement?
- clean the data
    - specifically look at the tags and the problem description
    - do some exploratory data analysis
- look up [huggingface transformer](https://www.google.com/search?q=huggingface+transformers&oq=huggingface+transformer&aqs=chrome.0.0i131i433i457j69i57j0l6.2868j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
- use an attention model to classify the problems by tags
- do some cool stuff with it


## Dependencies:
- python3
